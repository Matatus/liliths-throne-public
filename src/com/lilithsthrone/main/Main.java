		+ "<p>"
			+ "This is the first public update which integrates Irbynx's combat PR, and as such, you will notice several changes in combat, as well as with NPCs' stats and perk trees."
			+ " (More information in the patch notes below.)"
		+ "</p>"
			
		+ "<p>"
			+ "I know combat isn't the main focus of the game, but it was getting to the point where it was impossible to balance, and I'd therefore never be able to offer players a challenge with bosses without making these changes."
			+ " Clothing enchantments and permanent potion attributes were nerfed for the same reason - with practically unlimited upgrades on clothing/potions, it was impossible to even consider balancing any fights."
		+ "</p>"
			
		+ "<p>"
			+ "While this update will now allow me to balance combat numbers and boss fights, I haven't had time to get started on that yet (all of my time was spent implementing this new system), so the damage numbers are likely to be quite high and unbalanced."
			+ " I'll get that addressed for the next update, and will also improve the difficulty settings soon."
		+ "</p>"
			
		+ "<p>"
			+ "As lot of combat-related stuff was changed, there might be some issues/bugs."
			+ " If there are any really serious issues, I'll try to get a hotfix out as soon as I can."
		+ "</p>"
			
		+ "<p>"
			+ "<b>Please bear in mind:</b> This isn't the final version of all the combat changes."
			+ " There will be further tweaks and adjustments to several areas, and there still needs to be a balancing of the damage numbers."

			+ "Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or offering financial backing!"

			+"<ul>The extra effect of the spell 'Rain Cloud', 'Cloud burst', is now triggered by being hit by a critical attack, instead of being triggered by missing an attack.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Special tease attacks now do limited damage vs enemies who dislike the associated fetish. (i.e. Doing a 'virility tease' on someone who dislikes the 'pregnancy' fetish will only do 1 damage.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>You can now set an allied and enemy target, so you don't have to keep on switching target to cast friendly spells/abilities.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Beneficial spells & abilities will now automatically be applied to your allied target, whereas detrimental spells, abilities, and attacks will be applied to your enemy target.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The main three stat bars (physique/arcane/corruption) are now hidden during combat, so that it's easier to see multiple combatant's stats.</ul>"

			+"<li>Bugs:</ul>"
			+"<ul>Typo/parsing fixes.</ul>"

			+"<li>Gameplay:</li>"
			+"<ul><b>All permanent attribute boosts for all characters will be reset upon loading into the game.</b></ul>"
			+"<ul><b>All characters' perk trees will be reset upon loading into the game.</b></ul>"

			+"<ul>The perk trees for all non-elementals (including that of the player) have been modified. Added several new traits and perks, and the 'root' lust perk is now unlocked by default.</ul>"
			+"<ul>You can no longer go 'back up' the perk tree to unlock perks. All unlock progress must now always be down or on the same level.</ul>"
			+"<ul>All NPCs no longer have attributes assigned to them upon creation, and instead select perks based on their subspecies's preferences.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who are enslaved no longer have their job-related trait converted into the slave trait. Characters who spawn into the game as slaves will have the slave trait, however.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Altered aura calculation to rely more on the value of your arcane attribute.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Added shielding for energy damage as a separate shielding type from physical.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Block now blocks all energy damage, not just physical.</ul>"

		+ "<br/>"

			+"<ul>Removed a few final instances of the old resistance calculation being used.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Did some balancing of status effect and perk attribute bonuses (mainly reducig some resistance values here and there).</ul>"
